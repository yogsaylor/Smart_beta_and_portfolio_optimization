# Smart_beta_and_portfolio_optimization

Built a smart beta portfolio and compared it to a benchmark index. Calculated the tracking error against the index. Then built a portfolio by using quadratic programming to optimize the weights. Calculated turn over to evaluate the performance. Then used this metric to find the optimal rebalancing frequency. Used the end_of_day dataset from Quotemedia.
